<!--ðŸ‘‰  reste Ã  faire  -->

I gave this test some parts of the weekend, can't give more in the week I am still in a current mission.

So I did the biggest part, but I still have to do the following next weekend if before the interview:

- cart store works => add UI in the side nav
- take into account error and loading states in carousel
- animate the carousel
- animate and beautify the sidenav
- cleaning the code from test variables, console.logs etc
- Add the missing animations in SecretCollection page
- unit tests
- remove unused imports and test components
- fixe the tsx issues in console
- 'handleResize' in one "helpers" file
